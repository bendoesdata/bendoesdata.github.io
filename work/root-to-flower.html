                <p>
                    In collaboration with <a href="https://www.spearheadinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Spearhead Interactive</a> and <a href="http://www.joesarahphotography.com/" target="_blank">Joe Sarah Photography</a>, I led the team at <a href="www.infogr8.com"
                        target="_blank">infogr8</a> to create a series of custom infographics to view in augmented reality. After downloading the app, guests were invited to discover these infographics by exploring their surroundings and finding specific
                    trigger images to point their phone camera at. Guests could also point their cameras at the large-scale food photography hanging on the walls to view the recipes that would be served that evening.

                <p>
                    Before starting the design process, I researched and analyzed data on global food waste to find the most impactful facts to feature at the event. These stats were then contextualised alongside other data to help people put the numbers in perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example: did you know that the amount of global food waste is 4x the amount needed to feed all the malnourished people in the world? I then worked with a team of designers to take these facts and produce a series of visualisations that weaved together
                    a narrative around food waste.
